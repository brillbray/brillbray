<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Brillian Braydent</h1>
<h3 align="justify">People usually call me Brill. Currently, i am majoring in Game Application & Technology as a student at Bina Nusantara University. I like to do some simple game project, because i interested to work as a game programmer or 3D Artist , but sometimes i also like to do some art from pixel art, 2D line Art, also design a game with my own imagination of gameplay. I usually use unity to make game. Beside that, i also do some web project in my free time, like HTML, CSS, JS, included ReactJS from JS library, and some other programming languanges. </h3>
